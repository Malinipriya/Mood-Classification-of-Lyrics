There's going to be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's going to be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

[Verse 1]
How many I told you'd
And start overs and shoulders
Have you cried on before
How many promises be honest girl
How many tears you let hit the floor
How many bags you'd packed
Just to take'em back, tell me that
How many either OR's
But no more, 
If you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

[Verse 2]
Oh oh
I saw so many pretty faces
Before I saw you, you
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you
No no
Don't need these other pretty faces
Like I need you
And when your mine in the world

[Pre-Chorus]

There's gone be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's going to be one less lonely girl
I'm going to put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world
There's going to be one less lonely girl

[Verse 3]
Christmas wasn't merry
14th of February
Not one offend spent with you
How many dinner dates
Set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, If you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

[Verse 4]
Oh oh
I saw so many pretty faces
Before I saw you, you
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you
No no
Don't need these other pretty faces
Like I need you
And when your mine in this world

[Chorus]
There's going to be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's going to be one less lonely girl
I'm going to put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world
There's going to be one less lonely girl

[Verse 5]
I can fix up your broken heart
I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe
I just want to set one girl free to fall (free to fall)
She's free to fall (fall in love)
With me
My hearts locked and nowhere that I got the key
I'll take her and leave the world
With one less lonely girl

[Pre-Chorus]
There's going to be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's going to be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

[Chorus]
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's going to be one less lonely girl
I'm going to put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world

[Verse 6]
There's going to be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's going to be one less lonely girl
I'm going to put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world
There's going to be one less lonely girl
