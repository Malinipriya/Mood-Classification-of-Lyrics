You could've been all I wanted
But you weren't honest now get in the ground
You choked off the surest of favors
But if you really loved me you would've endured my world

Well if you're just as I presumed
A whore in sheep's clothing
Fucking up all I do and if so here we stop
Then never again will you see this in your life

Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion
You seem to take premise to all of these songs

You stormed off to scar the armada
Like Jesus played martyr, I'll drill through your hands
The stone for the curse you have blamed me
With love and devotion, I'll die as you sleep

But if you could just write me out
To never less wonder happy will I become
Be true that this is no option
So with sin I condemn you demon play, demon out

Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion
You seem to take premise to all of these songs

One last kiss for you, one more wish to you
Please make up your mind girl
I'd do anything for you

One last kiss for you, one more wish to you
Please make up your mind girl
Before I hope you die
