The more of you that I inspect
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask you're wearing rips

But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities

Engaged in crime, I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind, starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry, ow

And when the story takes a twist
If folds like a contortionist
Slight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged

Engaged in crime, I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind, starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry

The searing of the sinew, my body fights for air
The ripping of the tissue, my lungs begin to tear
Gravity's got my bones, it pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates and I make my sweaty face

Association that I choose, game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws, set up by me, fracture it's jaw to let me be
A cut-out cardboard condo maze, filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare as music rubber hosed the air

Engaged in crime, I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind, starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry again
And again and again, again

Engaged in crime, I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind, starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry, ow
