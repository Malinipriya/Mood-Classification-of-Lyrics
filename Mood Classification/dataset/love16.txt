Oh no, oh no, oh
They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love (of love, of love)
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug (last hug, last hug)

There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality (reality, reality)
And when you hold my hand then I understand
That it's meant to be

'Cause baby when you're with me
It's like an angel came by (oh)
And took me to heaven
(Like you took me to heaven, girl)
'Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better
(I don't want you to go, oh no)

So let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure
That I'll never let you go

I got my favorite girl
Not feeling no pain, no fear (no fear, no fear)
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here? (are here, are here)

There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor
Baby, there's no hesitation
No reservation
By taking a chance and more

Oh no, because
It's like an angel came by
And took me to heaven
(Like you took me to heaven, girl)
'Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better
(I don't want you to go, oh no)

So let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure
That I'll never let you go

It's like an angel came by
And took me to heaven
(Like you took me to heaven, girl)
'Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better
(I don't want you to go, oh no, so)

Take my hand (take my hand)
Let's just dance (let's just dance)
Watch my feet (watch my feet)
Follow me (follow me)
Don't be scared (don't be scared)
Girl, I'm here (girl, I'm here)
If you didn't (if you didn't know) know, this is love

Let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
(Oh baby)
'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure
That I'll never let you go

So don't fear
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I am here
(I'll never let you go)
Don't she'd a tear
Whenever you need me
I'll be here
I'll never let you go

Oh no, oh no, oh
I'll never let you go
Oh no, oh no, oh
I'll never let you go
