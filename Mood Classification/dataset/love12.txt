You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
She doesn't get your humour like I do

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you'll wake up and find
That what you're lookin for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin the streets with you and your all worn out jeans,
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on the park bench thinkin to myself
Hey isn't this easy?

And you've got that smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in awhile, since she brought you down
You say you fine I know you better than that
Hey, Whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you'll wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standin by, I'm waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're about to cry
I know your favorite songs and you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong. I think I know it's with me.

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by, I'm waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
