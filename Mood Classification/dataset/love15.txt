It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

I don't want to miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chillin' with my folks, I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

Word on the street's Santa's comin' tonight, 
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

Hey love
The wise men follow the star (The wise men follow the star)
They way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle

Hey love 
Don't you buy me nothing (don't you buy me nothing)
Cuz I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That's a very, Merry Christmas

It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow (I know)
But I'mma be under the mistletoe 

I don't want to miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

(Kiss me underneath the mistletoe)
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
(Show me baby that you love me so)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

(Kiss me underneath the mistletoe)
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
(Show me baby that you love me so)
Ohhh, ohhh, 
Mmmm
