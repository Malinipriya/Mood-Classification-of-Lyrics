Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Cool calm and all collected
Try hide that hate from me
Let go pass by an unaffected
For what reason you choose
To never expose!
Resolute in denying emotions
It's there weather, like it or not
Lash out, hun, make it atrocious
One shot!
Show for what you lack!
Spill your guts now don't hold it back
C'mon bring it on and let me feel it
I want that teenage rampage, mayhem and outrage
C'mon scream it out til I believe it
We need that front page outrage, alright
Make it bleed between the lines
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Cold... Cold calm and disconnected
Fine line 'tween heaven and hell
Today determines tomorrow
Ya all get just what I say
We said!
Let go, give in to the moment
Lash out in a violent display
My time, your time to go when
Rise up
Show for what you got
Ready to burn then rip it out
C'mon bring it on and let me feel it
I want that teenage rampage, mayhem and outrage
C'mon scream it out til I believe it
We need that front page outrage, alright
Make it bleed between the lines
C'mon bring it on... (bring it on...)
C'mon scream it out... (scream it out...)
C'mon bring it on and let me feel it
I want that teenage rampage, mayhem and outrage
C'mon scream it out til I believe it
We need that front page outrage, alright
Make it bleed between the lines
C'mon bring it on and let me feel it
I want that teenage rampage, mayhem and outrage
C'mon scream it out til I believe it
We need that front page outrage, alright
Make it bleed between the lines
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
